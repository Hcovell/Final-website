    <h3>There is plenty of performing arts you can participate in. One of which is Choir. A choir is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm, hand, and facial gestures.</h3>
